# Classes are custom data types (int,string etc)
# Objects are initialised classes, that can be set to a variable (a = 3, b = "yes" etc)

``` python
    class X(A):
```
# class X inherits from or extends class A

``` python
    def __init__(self):
```
# constructor method

# class methods must have at least 1 parameter. The standard is to call this "self". It acts as a reference to the object.
